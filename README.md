I wanted to make a visual file structure but felt that I had to move everything kinda like in sync-bot
REASON:
im really bad at everything docker, so its basically sync-bot Ctrl+C/V. I am sincerely sorry.

havent really done logging, but ig its not SO HARD

hand-tested this lol. would be great if I can learn how to test it better way

also, its my first readme, sorry for my bad englandsky, code, comments, and README itself.

ciao
